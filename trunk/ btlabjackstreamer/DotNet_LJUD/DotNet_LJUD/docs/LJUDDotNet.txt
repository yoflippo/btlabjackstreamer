LJUDDotNet Driver
August, 1st 2007

The .NET driver uses the LabJackUD Driver for Windows.  For more information, 
see the user's guide for the UD drivers available at:

http://www.labjack.com/downloads.html

This .zip file contains what you should need to create .NET (using c# or 
VB.NET) applications that work with your LabJack UE9, U3 and the LabJackUD driver.

The .dll is included with the LabJackUD driver during the intallation process.  It is not 
included in this package, but should already be in your LabJack\drivers directory.    
The .dll contains a wrapper object, which acts as an interface between .NET 
and the UD driver.  Since the UD driver functions are being called the LabJackUD.dll 
is needed.  The LJUDDotNet interface provides an easy way to develop .NET 
applications that work with the UE9 and U3. 

This is currently still in development so there may be a few bugs.  If you 
find any please let us know at support@labjack.com.  

To install, simply unzip this download into your LabJack directory (Default:  
C:\Program Files\LabJack or unzip it somewhere and move the contents into the 
LabJack folder.

Included Files:

\Examples\LJUDDotNet\UE9\Simple - A folder that contains a sample Visual 
Studio.NET project in C# that shows basic usage of the LJUDDotNet .dll to 
perform some simple tasks with a UE9. 

\Examples\LJUDDotNet\UE9\StreamExample- A console app that shows usage
 with a simple stream example and a UE9. 

\Examples\LJUDDotNet\UE9\VBSimple – Folder with a simple UE9 VB.NET example.

\Examples\LJUDDotNet\UE9\VBStream – Stream example using VB.NET and a UE9.

\Examples\LJUDDotNet\U3\U3AllIO - A console app that shows usage with 
 multiple analog and digital I/O and a U3. 

\Examples\LJUDDotNet\U3\U3Simple - Folder with a simple U3 C# .NET example

\Examples\LJUDDotNet\U3\U3VBSimple - Folder with a simple U3 VB.NET example


Use of the object is fairly straightforward.  It should be added to the project 
using Visual Studio (or your specific IDE).  If you are using Visual 
Studio.NET, you can add the .dll by right clicking on the project in the file 
view menu, and selecting add reference.  Then locate the dll and it will be 
added to the project.  The dll's component name is LabJackUD .Net.  LabJackUDDotNet 
references the original LabJackUD.dll which must be available to run during runtime.  

Each of the supported LabJackUD functions has a static wrapper function inside the 
LJUD object created by the .dll. You must first specify that you are using the 
LabJack namespace, which in C# can be done by:

using LabJack.LabJackUD;

You can call each static function by using the LJUD object, followed by the 
function you want to call.  The parameters are specified almost exactly as they are 
listed in the LabJackUD User's Guide.  However you can see the included usage file 
to get a full listing.  You can also view the .dll inside Visual Studio.NET and see
what functions are included as well as the parameters they require.

There are also UE9 and U3 objects, and several enumerated types to make working with the 
UD driver easier.  Here is an example of a function call to OpenLabJack using C#

int ljhandle = 0;

LJUD.LJUDERROR e = OpenLabJack(LJUD.DEVICE.UE9, 
	LJUD.CONNECTION.USB, “0”, true, ref ljhandle);

Please refer to the LJUDDotNetUsage.txt file included in this download for more information 
using the LJUDDotNet driver.  

We are very interested in your feedback.  If you have any suggestions, questions 
or comments about the setup of these drivers please email us (support@labjack.com) 
and let us know.
